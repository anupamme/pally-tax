Bot: Let me just ask you couple of quick questions:
a. Do you live in a rented house? If yes, how much rent do you pay?
A: Yes. I pay Rs 25000 per month.
b. Cool, do you also own a house in Bangalore?
A: Not yet.

Bot: Based on this information we can help you save your taxable HRA. One momene please...

So your current taxable HRA is 30K but if you show rent receipts, then you can bring it down to 15K. That is a saving of 15K a month in taxable income.

A: Really. What do I need to do for this.
Bot: all I can say is you just need to show your rent receipts to your HR and tell them that your taxable HRA should be only 15K. If you need more help I can put you in touch with one of our tax experts.
